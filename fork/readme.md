	Server handles multiple clients by splitting new connnections
	into their own processes through a call to fork(). sig_chld
	signals are dealt with by the signal manager in ServerUtility.c,
	uses waitpid().

	Client achieves I/O Multiplexing using a 'do not wait at all'
	waiting method through a call to select().
